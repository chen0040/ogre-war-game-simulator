Description:
The G6 self propelled howitzer was developed around the ordnance of the G5 howitzer. It is one of the most powerful self-propelled equipment on a wheeled chassis. In addition to the logistical mobility afforded by a wheeled chassis, the G6 is protected against counter battery fire and is able to defend itself in an unsecured area. The chassis is mine protected. The G6 is produced by the LIW division of DENEL Corporation in South Africa. It entered production in 1987.
